##Geoportal Server customizations for ISO 19115-2

Geoportal Server customizations, originally obtained from this link
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eds/tds/downloads/NGDC_customizations.zip
on the GEO-IDE ESRI Geoportal information:
https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ESRI_Geoportal

The idea is that you install Geoportal Server, unzip these custimizations at the top level, and all the configuration files end up at the right spot.  And then you have the same customizations as NGDC.
